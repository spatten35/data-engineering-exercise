# Fender Digital Data Engineering Exercise

Design and implement a data pipeline that that pulls data from [Open Library.]https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books As an out put of this exercise we expect to see a minimum of the following:

1. Python program that pulls data from the rest api
2. CSV files for the following:
	* Authors
	* Books
	* Authors and Books (a bridge table between the previous entities)
3. DDL to create a hypothetical database schema ( you don't have to create a DB but you are welcome to)

The objective of this exercise is to have you walk us through a solution you have created. Do as much or as little as you would like.


# ReadMe
Please include:
* a readme file that explains your thinking
* a data model showing your design, explain why you designed the db and include the DDL used to generate the tables in your database
* how to run and set up your project
* if you have tests, include instructions on how to run them
* a description of:
	* enhancements you might make
	* additional features you have added to help or that you found interesting
* questions you have
* recommendations for us


# Additional Info:
* we expect that this will take you a few hours to complete
* use any langugage or framework you are comfortable with we prefer Python
* Bonus points for setting up a db
* Bonus points for security, specs, etc.
* Do as little or as much as you like.

Please fork this repo and commit your code into that fork. Show your work and process through those commits.
